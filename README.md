# Tiller Test Dev Backend

## Test 1

Write a webservice that compute the sum of the numbers in a given list using a for-loop, foreach-loop, a while-loop, and recursion.

## Test 2

Write a webservice that combines two lists by alternatingly taking elements. For exemple: given two lists [A, B, C] and [1, 2, 3], the results sould be [A, 1, B, 2, C, 3]

## Test 3

Let's A be a matrix
```
A = [ 2  3  2  1 ]  Allowed moves : → or ↓
    [ 5  2  3  1 ]
    [ 1  2  2  1 ]
width = 4
heigh = 3
```
 
You can move RIGTH or DOWN.
You cannot move UP or LEFT. 

Write a webservice that calculate the highest path sum in a matrix
following this rule (move only RIGTH or DOWN)

## Test 4

Write a webservice that computes the list of the first n Fibonacci numbers. By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

As an example, here are the first 10 Fibonnaci numbers: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34].
