## Test 2

Write a webservice that combines two lists by alternatingly taking elements. For exemple: given two lists [A, B, C] and [1, 2, 3], the results sould be [A, 1, B, 2, C, 3]

## Test 3

Let's A be a matrix
A = [ 2  3  2  1 ]
    [ 5  2  3  1 ]
    [ 1  2  2  1 ]
width = 4
heigh = 3
 
You can move RIGTH or DOWN.
You cannot move UP or LEFT. 

Write a webservice that calculate the highest path sum in a matrix
following this rule (move only RIGTH or DOWN)
